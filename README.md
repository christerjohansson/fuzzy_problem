# fuzzy_problem
This repository is a demonstration of my solution to the well know Fizz Buzz text many companies and agencies apply to their candidates. The problem is really easy to solve, the problem is mathematic. 

Fizz buzz is a group word game to teach about division. It take turns to count incrementally, replacing any number divisible by three with the word "fizz", and any number divisible by five with the word "buzz", and every 15th number with "FizzBuzz".

My three solutions is written in C#.
The first solution uses a IF/ELSE-query, the second uses a for-loop with Console output, the third solution uses a Enumerable range in a List to output the correct words and numbers.
